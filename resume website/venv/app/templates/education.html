{% block first %}<br>Lower Canada College<br><br>{% endblock %}
{% block firstpara %}I attended Lower Canada College for the the entirety of my primary and secondary 
education. The school has a kindergarten program, which I attended as well. This is a picture of me in physics class
in the ninth grade.{% endblock %}
{% block secondpara %}Going to this school was a true pleasure. Among the countless life lessons I learned
throughout my time in this school, the most important one was respect. This school taught me to respect
people. I was taught that everyone deserves to be shown respect. I will carry this lesson throughout my life
and I will never forget it. I finished my life at LCC by doing grade 12. Following that, I came to Concordia. This is where I'm studing now
and so far, I like the school.{% endblock %}

{% block toptitle %}<br>Concordia University{% endblock %}
{% block onepara %}<br>I now go to school at Concordia University in Montreal. I am doing a Bachelor of Engineering
and majoring in Software Engineering. I'm doing the extended credit program. I had to choose this program because 
I went to grade 12 at LCC. By going to grade 12, I skipped cegep completely. I had to make up for this by taking 
courses at Concordia such as Linear Algebra, Mechanics, Electricity & Magnetism and Calculus 2. I am now taking core 
courses.{% endblock %}
{% block twopara %}I have really been enjoying the university experience. Concordia is a nice school 
and I have made a lot of great friends during my time here. The professors have been good with 
a few really standing out as being the best at what they do. Although being in Software Engineering is a big 
accomplishment, I will continue to work hard and always strive to do better than I am doing now. {% endblock %}
