{% block first %}<br><br>Trip to India<br><br>{% endblock %}
{% block firstpara %}I went on a community service trip to an orphanage in India! This orphanage was located in the southern
part of India. There were over 300 kids there and they were all some of the kindest people I have ever met. They were so glad 
to see us and were very grateful for our help.{% endblock %}

{% block toptitle %}<br><br><br>What We Did{% endblock %}
{% block onepara %}<br><br>Along with the other members of staff at the orphanage we performed daily tasks with the kids and also showed 
many of them individual attention, which is something many of them really lack. Throughout the days we did may things, like for example,
take care of the livestock. In this picture on the right I am washing one of the cows that the orphanage uses to produce milk.
The Indian people worship cows and as such they need to be taken very good care of. I was also given the chance to milk a cow
which was a very interesting experience and is something that is definetly not as easy as it looks.{% endblock %}

{% block trepara %}<br>After spending three days in India, helping out at this orphanage and spending time with the kids I learned to be
grateful for what I have. I learned that I am really lucky to be living in Canada, and going on this trip really put things
into perspective about just how lucky I am to be living in a nice home, with a beautiful family, going to a nice school. I really 
couldn't ask for more and this trip was very humbling.{% endblock %}
